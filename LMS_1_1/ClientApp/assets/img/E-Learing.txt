   - improve the quailty of the code
        -to add more error handling
        -break the code into small peices.

Automated Testing Advantages
-Repetable
-better code coverage
-Regression testing is faster
-Automate setup and tear down


you have also implement
- Assembly Initialize and clean up 
-Class Intialize and clean up
-Test Intialize and clean up  

in your test project to manage all the resources
